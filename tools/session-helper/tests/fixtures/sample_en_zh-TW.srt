00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to the tutorial.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Today we'll learn about machine learning.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,500
It allows computers to learn from data
without being explicitly programmed.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's start with the basics.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,000
First, we need to understand what data is.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Data can be numbers, text, images, or any other form.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,000
The more data we have, the better our model can learn.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,000
Now, let's look at a simple example.

00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,000
Thank you for watching!
